## About me
- :school: As a final year IT student, I find myself on the brink of an exciting milestone: graduation.
- 📚 Currently, I'm immersed in the world of web development, focusing particularly on front-end development as I intern in this field. Alongside honing my skills in that, I'm eager to expand my knowledge to include software testing, back-end or business analyst. I believe that gaining practical experience in these fields will complement my existing skills and greatly benefit my future career.
- 💪🏼 Future Goals: My main goal is to become a better programmer in the future. I want to keep improving my coding skills, learn new technologies, and stay up to date with the latest developments in the IT industry.
- ⚡ Fun fact: During moments when I'm not engrossed in my studies or coding projects, I find solace in playing games, experimenting with melodies on my piano, and indulging in movies. These activities offer me a delightful escape, providing a chance to unwind and recharge amidst the demands of daily life.
